## 1. Data Acquisition
- **Process:** Obtain raw sequencing data from the sequencing platform (e.g., Illumina, PacBio, Oxford Nanopore).
- **Formats:** Data is typically in FASTQ format, containing short nucleotide sequences with associated quality scores.

## 2. Quality Control
- **Objective:** Assess and ensure the quality of the raw sequencing data.
- **Steps:**
  - Evaluate base quality scores to identify potential sequencing errors.
  - Remove or trim low-quality reads and adaptors.
  - Verify overall data quality metrics using tools like FastQC.

## 3. Reference-based or De Novo Assembly
### Reference-based:
- **Process:** Align sequenced reads to a known reference genome.
- **Tools:** Utilize aligners such as BWA, Bowtie, or HISAT2.
- **Applications:** Variant calling, resequencing, and identification of genomic variations.

### De Novo:
- **Process:** Assemble reads into contigs without relying on a reference genome.
- **Tools:** Assemblers like SPAdes, Velvet, or SOAPdenovo.
- **Applications:** Studying non-model organisms, identifying novel genomes, or in the absence of a reference genome.

## 4. Assembly Quality Assessment
- **Objective:** Evaluate the quality and completeness of the assembled genome.
- **Steps:**
  - Calculate metrics such as N50, representing the contig length at which 50% of the assembly is contained.
  - Assess the presence of gaps, misassemblies, and potential contamination.
  - Validate the assembly using tools like BUSCO to measure the completeness of conserved genes.

## 5. Additional Analyses (Optional)
- **Variant Calling:** Identify genetic variations, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions/deletions (indels).
- **Functional Annotation:** Annotate genes and predict their functions.
- **Comparative Genomics:** Compare genomes across different individuals or species.
- **Phylogenetic Analysis:** Reconstruct evolutionary relationships based on genetic data.

# Summary
The DNA sequencing and analysis pipeline involves acquiring raw data, performing quality control, choosing between reference-based or de novo assembly, and assessing the quality of the assembled genome. Additional analyses can be conducted to extract biological insights from the genomic data.

- Need for robust computational resources

-  RAM exhaustion issues due to limited resources

For some simulations (resource allocations) due lack of RAM leads to a higher number of contigs and a lower N50 value 

Insufficient RAM can cause extended data swapping to disk, leading to increased assembly times and potential bottlenecks in processing.
**Workaround** - Increase the resource allocations.

## Results of Tomato Genome Assembly
![image](https://github.com/ShenalPerera/e17-4yp-Comparative-Analysis-of-2nd-and-3rd-Generation-Sequencing/assets/73387610/38066f9d-f760-4381-9c1b-22e56a68fc8a)

## What Has Been Achieved
- Quality Analysis
  - Nanopore's Higher N50: Indicates more contiguous and potentially higher-quality assemblies than Illumina.
  - Illumina's Fragmentation: More contigs suggest lower assembly coherence compared to Nanopore.
  - Resource Impact: Larger RAM notably improves assembly quality for both technologies.
  - Quality Scaling: Nanopore assembly quality increases more with additional computational resources.
    
- Performance Analysis
  - Time Efficiency: Nanopore assembly is slower but improves with added computational resources, while Illumina is inherently faster.
  - Resource Impact: Increased CPU and RAM consistently reduce assembly times for both technologies but with diminishing returns.
  - Diminishing Returns: The reduction in time is not linear. When allocating more resources, the amount of time saved becomes less pronounced.
  - RAM vs. CPU: Enhanced RAM more significantly optimizes assembly time and quality than additional CPU threads.

## General Insights from the Assembly Runs

- Time taken for error corrections was higher in nanopore sequencing than the Illumina sequencing
  - Due to the Overlap-Layout-Consensus (OLC) approach

- The pass rate for Nanopore data, through the Base Call technique, is significantly low
  - Short reads vs. Longer reads

- Read coverage crucial in Nanopore de-novo assembly
  - Depending on the predicted Genome size
